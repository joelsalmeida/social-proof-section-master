## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

### What I learned

This is my third challenge and I've learned that: practice really makes perfect. I'm much more comfortable with different concepts and tags.

In this project, I also had the opportunity to work with images adapted to multiple resolutions and "z index". "It was really fun"

It was also interesting to work with a slightly bigger challenge. And I could see how a well-organized code facilitates and speeds up the entire project.

### Continued development

Bigger projects, here I go!
